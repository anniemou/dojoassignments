                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform , object-oriented scripting languare. JavaScript is extremery popular for a variety of reasons.It
                    is a small and lightwight languare allowing maximum flexibility for decelopers to take it in a bunch
                    of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server),it
                    can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

                <div class="text">
                    <li>
                        <a href="#">Variable Declaration</a>
                        <p> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee,
                            the cup holds the doffe, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified
                            with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers:<span class="blue">var x;</span></p>

                        <li>
                            <a href="#">Variable Assignment</a>
                            <p>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee pourd
                                in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to
                                a variable.<span class="blue">x = 10;</span></p> 

                            <li>
                                <a href="#">Data Types</a>
                                <p>Data Types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know
                                    the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="blue">true</span>
                                    or <span class="blue">false</span><span class="blue">null</span>aka nothing;
                                     Number - <span class="blue">42;</span> or <span class="blue"> 3.14159;</span>
                                     <span class="blue">String -"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>
                                    Array - [<span class="1"></span>,<span class="coding"></span>,<span class="2"></span>, <span class="blue">Dojo</span>};
                                     and Object - {<span class="blue">first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}></span></p>

                                <li>
                                    <a href="#">Conditionals</a>

                                    <p>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions- hitting
                                        different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use
                                        conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional
                                        statements: <span class="blue">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block;<span class="blue">else if</span> 
                                         to specify a new condition to test, <span class="blue">if</span> the first condition is false; else we execute
                                        this block of code;</p>
                                    <li>
                                        <a href="#">Loops</a>
                                    </li>

                                    <p>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially
                                        do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have
                                        to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's
                                        a loop</p>
                                    <li>
                                        <a href="#">Functions</a>
                                    </li>

                                    <p>Functions ar ean encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function, this will
                                        run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example, imagine
                                        we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get
                                        started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right
                                        way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more of tables
                                        to do so lets call our function over and over again.
